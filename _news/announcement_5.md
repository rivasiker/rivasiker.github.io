I have officially started my postdoc at the Max Planck Insitute for Evolutionary Anthopology in Leipzig. As part of the Department of Primate Behavior and Evolution, I will be analyzing the evolutionary history of primates, linking observational field data from natural primate populations to newly generated whole-genome sequencing data.
