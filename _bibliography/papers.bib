  abstract = {Genome-wide genealogies of multiple species carry detailed information about demographic and selection processes on individual branches of the phylogeny. Here, we introduce TRAILS, a hidden Markov model that accurately infers time-resolved population genetics parameters, such as ancestral effective population sizes and speciation times, for ancestral branches using a multi-species alignment of three species and an outgroup. TRAILS leverages the information contained in incomplete lineage sorting fragments by modelling genealogies along the genome as rooted three-leaved trees, each with a topology and two coalescent events happening in discretized time intervals within the phylogeny. Posterior decoding of the hidden Markov model can be used to infer the ancestral recombination graph for the alignment and details on demographic changes within a branch. Since TRAILS performs posterior decoding at the base-pair level, genome-wide scans based on the posterior probabilities can be devised to detect deviations from neutrality. Using TRAILS on a human-chimp-gorilla-orangutan alignment, we recover speciation parameters and extract information about the topology and coalescent times at high resolution.},

    Comparative analysis of primate genomes within a phylogenetic context is essential for understanding the evolution of 
    human genetic architecture and primate diversity. We present such a study of 50 primate species spanning 38 genera and 
    14 families, including 27 genomes first reported here, with many from previously less well represented groups, the New 
    World monkeys and the Strepsirrhini. Our analyses reveal heterogeneous rates of genomic rearrangement and gene evolution 
    across primate lineages. Thousands of genes under positive selection in different lineages play roles in the nervous, 
    skeletal, and digestive systems and may have contributed to primate innovations and adaptations. Our study reveals that 
    many key genomic innovations occurred in the Simiiformes ancestral node and may have had an impact on the adaptive 
    radiation of the Simiiformes and human evolution.

    Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) causes the phylogeny of some parts of the genome to differ from the species tree. 
    In this work, we investigate the frequencies and determinants of ILS in 29 major ancestral nodes across the entire 
    primate phylogeny. We find up to 64\% of the genome affected by ILS at individual nodes. We exploit ILS to 
    reconstruct speciation times and ancestral population sizes. Estimated speciation times are much more recent than 
    genomic divergence times and are in good agreement with the fossil record. We show extensive variation of ILS along 
    the genome, mainly driven by recombination but also by the distance to genes, highlighting a major impact of selection 
    on variation along the genome. In many nodes, ILS is reduced more on the X chromosome compared with autosomes than 
    expected under neutrality, which suggests higher impacts of natural selection on the X chromosome. Finally, we show 
    an excess of ILS in genes with immune functions and a deficit of ILS in housekeeping genes. The extensive ILS in 
    primates discovered in this study provides insights into the speciation times, ancestral population sizes, and 
    patterns of natural selection that shape primate evolution.

    Phase-type distributions describe the time until absorption of a continuous or discrete-time
    Markov chain. The probabilistic properties of phase-type distributions
    (i.e., the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, quantile function,
    moments and generating functions) are well-described and analytically tractable using matrix
    manipulations. Phase-type distributions have traditionally been used in actuarial sciences and queuing theory,
    and, more recently, in population genetics. In order to facilitate the use of phase-type theory
    in population genetics, we present PhaseTypeR, a general-purpose and user-friendly R 
    package which contains all key functions —mean, (co)variance, probability density
    function, cumulative distribution function, quantile function and random sampling— for both
    continuous and discrete phase-type distributions. Importantly, univariate and multivariate
    reward transformations are implemented for continuous and discrete phase-type distributions.
    Multivariate reward transformations have great potential for applications in population genetics,
    and we have included two examples. The first is concerned with the easy calculation of the
    variance-covariance matrix for the site frequency spectrum (SFS) of the n-coalescent, and
    the second is concerned with the correlation between tree heights in the two-locus ancestral
    recombination graph.

  abstract={
    Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) makes ancestral genetic polymorphisms persist during rapid speciation events, 
    inducing incongruences between gene trees and species trees. ILS has complicated phylogenetic inference in many 
    lineages, including hominids. However, we lack empirical evidence that ILS leads to incongruent phenotypic variation. 
    Here, we performed phylogenomic analyses to show that the South American monito del monte is the sister lineage of 
    all Australian marsupials, although over 31% of its genome is closer to the Diprotodontia than to other Australian 
    groups due to ILS during ancient radiation. Pervasive conflicting phylogenetic signals across the whole genome are 
    consistent with some of the morphological variation among extant marsupials. We detected hundreds of genes that 
    experienced stochastic fixation during ILS, encoding the same amino acids in non-sister species. Using functional 
    experiments, we confirm how ILS may have directly contributed to hemiplasy in morphological traits that were 
    established during rapid marsupial speciation ca. 60 mya.
