  abstract = {Phase-type distributions describe the time until absorption of a continuous or discrete-time
    Markov chain. The probabilistic properties of phase-type distributions
    (i.e., the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, quantile function,
    moments and generating functions) are well-described and analytically tractable using matrix
    manipulations. Phase-type distributions have traditionally been used in actuarial sciences and queuing theory,
    and, more recently, in population genetics. In order to facilitate the use of phase-type theory
    in population genetics, we present PhaseTypeR, a general-purpose and user-friendly R 
    package which contains all key functions —mean, (co)variance, probability density
    function, cumulative distribution function, quantile function and random sampling— for both
    continuous and discrete phase-type distributions. Importantly, univariate and multivariate
    reward transformations are implemented for continuous and discrete phase-type distributions.
    Multivariate reward transformations have great potential for applications in population genetics,
    and we have included two examples. The first is concerned with the easy calculation of the
    variance-covariance matrix for the site frequency spectrum (SFS) of the n-coalescent, and
    the second is concerned with the correlation between tree heights in the two-locus ancestral
    recombination graph.},

  title={Incomplete lineage sorting and phenotypic evolution in marsupials},

  abstract={Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) makes ancestral genetic polymorphisms persist during rapid speciation events, inducing incongruences between gene trees and species trees. ILS has complicated phylogenetic inference in many lineages, including hominids. However, we lack empirical evidence that ILS leads to incongruent phenotypic variation. Here, we performed phylogenomic analyses to show that the South American monito del monte is the sister lineage of all Australian marsupials, although over 31% of its genome is closer to the Diprotodontia than to other Australian groups due to ILS during ancient radiation. Pervasive conflicting phylogenetic signals across the whole genome are consistent with some of the morphological variation among extant marsupials. We detected hundreds of genes that experienced stochastic fixation during ILS, encoding the same amino acids in non-sister species. Using functional experiments, we confirm how ILS may have directly contributed to hemiplasy in morphological traits that were established during rapid marsupial speciation ca. 60 mya.},
