Aarhus University, Denmark

Hello there! I'm a PhD student primarily researching on primate phylogenomics. My interests include:
* Speciation processes, incomplete lineage sorting, admixture and introgression.
* Primate, bird and marsupial phylogenomics. 
* Hidden Markov models (e.g. SMC).
* Coalescent theory and phase-type distributions. 
* Data visualization. 

You can check out my [latest publications](/publications/). Feel free to connect with me over [email](ikerrivas96@gmail.com), [GitHub](https://github.com/rivasiker/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/irg_bio) or [Mastodon](https://ecoevo.social/@rivasiker).
