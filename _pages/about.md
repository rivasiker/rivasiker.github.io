Hello there! I'm a bioinformatician primarily researching on primate phylogenomics and population genetics. My interests include:
* Speciation processes, incomplete lineage sorting, admixture and introgression.
* Primate, bird and marsupial phylogenomics. 
* Hidden Markov models (e.g. SMC).
* Coalescent theory and phase-type distributions. 
* Data visualization. 

You can check out my latest publications [here](/publications/), and some of the software I have developed [here](/repositories/). Feel free to connect with me over <a href = "mailto: iker_rivas_gonzalez@eva.mpg.de">email</a> or [GitHub](https://github.com/rivasiker/).
